### Description
---
What prank is better than something that is completely harmless, but requires the victim to spend tedious time reversing your actions?

**Enter the Windows Desktop Burst:**
This payload is simple, it creates a configurable amount of virtual desktop spaces in Windows 10 (which are quite annoying to delete).



### Dependencies
---
None :)



### Configuration (optional)
---
In the b.ps1 file, you can change the amount of desktops made by changing the `$desktops` value. This will determine how many desktops to make.


### Status:
