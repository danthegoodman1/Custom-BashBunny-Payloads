# Window Killer

Alright you degenerates who intend to use this payload to prank others:

This payload sets a PowerShell script to run in the background that will hit `Alt-F4` every `X` about of seconds that you set it to. It also sets it as a startup script so people won't be able to kill it by rebooting.

This is the total troll.

Basically you just need to host the files somewhere (github works fine, just get a rawgithubusers download link for each of them), set the time interval to what you want, and "let 'er rip".

I have included a cleaner script because chances are it is going to be set to a time that doesn't allow a user to delete it manually (or at least the victim).

I made this in the process of testing one of the best dang payloads that is ever going to be made for the BashBunny
